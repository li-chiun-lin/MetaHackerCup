# Problem

Alex's New Year's resolution for 2015 is to eat healthier foods. He's done some research and has found out that calories come from three main sources, called macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Alex wants to get the right balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat to have a balanced diet. For each available food, Alex can only choose to eat it or not eat it. He can't eat a certain food more than once, and he can't eat a fractional amount of a food.

## Input

Input begins with an integer $T$, the number of test cases.  
For each test case, the first line consists of three space-separated integers: $G_P$, $G_C$, and $G_F$, which represent the amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat that Alex wants to eat.  
The next line has the number of foods for that test case, an integer $N$.  
The next $N$ lines each consist of three space-separated integers: $P$, $C$, and $F$, which represent the amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat in that food, respectively.
