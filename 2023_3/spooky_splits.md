# Problem

Mrs. Puff is taking her class trick-or-treating! Her $N$ students, numbered from $1$ to $N$, are dressed up in spooky outfits and ready to collect some candy. To divide and conquer every house in Bikini Bottom, she would like to break up the class into equal-sized groups.

$M$ pairs of students have similar-themed costumes that amplify their spookiness, the $i$-th being students $A_i$​ and $B_i$​. Ms. Puff's would like to know: for which values of $K$ can the class be divided into $K$ groups of equal size without splitting up any of these pairs?

## Input Format

Input begins with an integer $T$, the number of test cases.  
Each case begins with a line containing the two integers $N$ and $M$.  
Then, $M$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which contains the two integers $A_i$​ and $B_i$​.
