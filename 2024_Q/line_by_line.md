# Problem

You’ve found a solution to an implementation-heavy geometry problem that requires typing out $N$ lines of code. Annoyingly, you only have a $P\%$ chance of typing out any given line without a mistake, and your code will only be accepted if all $N$ lines are correct. The chance of making a mistake in one line is independent of the chance of making a mistake in any other line.

You realize there might be a solution which only requires $N−1$ lines (each also having a $P\%$ chance of being typed correctly). However, instead of thinking about that, you could also just type out the $N$-line solution more carefully to increase $P$. How much would $P$ have to increase to yield the same chance of success as needing to type one fewer line of code?

## Input Format

Input begins with an integer $T$, the number of test cases.
Each case is a single line containing the integers $N$ and $P$.
