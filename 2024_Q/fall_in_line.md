# Problem

As the queen of an ant colony, it’s your job to ensure that the antire colony works together. Your colony has $N$ worker ants, the $i$-th of which is currantly at coordinates $(X_i,Y_i)$. To align the efforts of all of your worker ants, you would like them to all be on the same line on the plane. How many of your ants need to move to get them to all lie on the same line?

As is frequantly the case in managemant, you don’t need an exact answer, but you do need some degree of accuracy. If the true minimum number of ants that need to move is $M$, then any answer between $M$ and $2 \times M$ (inclusive) will be accepted.

## Input Format

Input begins with an integer $T$, the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a line that contains the integer $N$.
Then $N$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which contains the integers $X_i$​ and $Y_i$​.
