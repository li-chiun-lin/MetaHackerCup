# Problem

Note: This is the easier version of Chapter 2. This version involves a string, but chapter 2 involves an array of integers that can change with updates.

A string is perfectly balanced if its length is even, and the first half of the string can be shuffled to make the string a palindrome.

A string is almost perfectly balanced if you can delete exactly one character from it to make it perfectly balanced.

You are given a larger template string $S$, and $Q$ substrings, the $i$-th of which is $S_{L_i..R_i}$​​.

For how many of these $Q$ queries is the substring almost perfectly balanced?
