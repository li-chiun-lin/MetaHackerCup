# Problem

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a grandparent in possession of a good fortune must furnish his or her grandchildren with cash on their birthdays. Your usual approach is to give each of your N grandchildren a number of dollars equal to their age, (That means 0 dollars for newborns; it's important that they learn what a rough place the world is from the very start).

One of your younger, and more precocious, grandchildren, Elly, has read online that trying out new things is a good way to prevent Alzheimer's. So, out of concern for your mental well-being (and in the hopes that she might receive more money), she's posed a new distribution scheme. "If any two grandchildren compare the size of their presents, they should find that both presents are divisible by an integer K. They should also find that there is no larger integer that divides the size of both presents," she states.

Well, that seems harmless enough, you think. Of course, each grandchild will still have to receive at least as much money as they would have under the old scheme, to avoid any family drama. As you're getting on in years, your mathematical prowess isn't what it used to be. It would be easier to write a program that computes the additional drain on your pocketbook.

Note that 0 is divisible by all other numbers.

## Input

The first line of the input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case starts with a line with the integers N and K.
The next line consists of the ages of your grandchildren as N integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
