# Problem

Let $S$ be a sequence of $N$ natural numbers. We can define an infinite sequence $MS$ in the following way: $MS[k] = S[k \mod N] + N \times floor(k / N)$. Where $k$ is a zero based index.

Now consider a subsequence of $MS$ generated by picking two random indices $a, b$ from the range $[0..R]$ inclusive, and taking all the elements between them, that is: $MS[\min(a, b)..\max(a, b)]$.

Your task is to calculate the probability that the selected subsequence has at least $K$ distinct elements. $a$ and $b$ are selected independently and with a uniform distribution. The result should be printed as a fraction. See the "Output" section for clarification.

## Input

The first line of the input file contains an integer $T$. This is followed by $T$ test cases, each of which has two lines.  
The first line of each test case contains three integers separated by spaces, $N, K$, and $R$.  
The second line contains $N$ space separated integers, $S[0]$ through $S[N-1]$.
