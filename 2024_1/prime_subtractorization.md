# Problem

A positive integer is an $N$-subtractorization if it is a prime number that can be expressed as the difference of two primes that are both at most $N$.
For a given $N$, how many $N$-subtractorizations are there?

## Input Format

Input begins with an integer $T$, the number of test cases. Each case is a single line that contains the integer $N$.
