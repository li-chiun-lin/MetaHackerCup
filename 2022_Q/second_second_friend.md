# Problem

Note: The only difference between this problem and **problem B1** is that here, scenes are larger and may contain rocks.

Boss Rob painted a beautiful scene on a 2D canvas of $R$ rows by $C$ columns, containing zero or more happy little trees and zero or more rocks.

To make sure none of his trees are lonely, Rob would like you to add as many trees as you'd like (possibly $0$) to empty spaces so that each tree in the final painting has at least two tree friends, that is, two trees which are each adjacent to it (directly to its north, south, east, or west). If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them.
