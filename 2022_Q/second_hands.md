# Problem

Sandy's store has $N$ pre-owned clock parts for sale, where the $i$-th part is of style $S_i$â€‹. The store also has two display cases, each capable of holding at most $K$ parts. To maximize the aesthetics of Sandy's secondhand second hands, she'd like to put each of the $N$ parts into one of the two cases so that neither case ends up with two different parts of the same style, and neither case has more than $K$ parts total. Can you determine if this is possible?

## Input

Input begins with an integer $T$, the number of test cases.  
For each test case, there is first a line containing 2 space-separated integers, $N$ and $K$.  
Then, there is a line containing $N$ space-separated integers, $S_1,...,S_N$.
