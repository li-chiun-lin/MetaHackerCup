# Problem

You, a perfect speller, have a vocabulary of $N$ distinct words, $V_1, ..., V_N$​, each consisting of exactly $L$ lowercase letters from the alphabet $\{$'m', 'e', 't', 'a'$\}$.

Your friend, a truely terrable speler, has attempted to write $Q$ of these words as $W_1, ..., W_Q$​, each also consisting of $L$ lowercase letters from the same alphabet.

Let $S_i$​ be the number of words in your vocabulary that differ from $W_i$​ at exactly two indices. Please determine the sum $S_1 + ... + S_Q$​.
