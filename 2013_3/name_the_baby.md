# Problem

 Jack is blessed with a baby and he and his wife want to name their child. Jack is a mathematician and his wife is very superstitious. She wants the baby's name to contain at least one of her ancestors names as a substring. They have decided that the baby's name should be exactly $L$ characters long, and will only consist of lowercase characters. Jack's wife gives Jack a list of $N$ strings, the names of her ancestors. Jack finds all the name possible names for his baby and lists them in alphabetical order. He asks you to choose the $K$-th (1-based) name in the list as the name for his child.

## Input

The first line contains $T$, the number of test cases.  
Each test case begins with the value of $L$ followed by a single integer $K$.  
The next line contains a single integer $N$ followed by $N$ lines, each containing the name of one of the wife's ancestors.
