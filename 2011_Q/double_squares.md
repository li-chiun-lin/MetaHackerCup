# Problem

A double-square number is an integer $X$ which can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares. For example, $10$ is a double-square because $10 = 3^2 + 1^2$. Your task in this problem is, given $X$, determine the number of ways in which it can be written as the sum of two squares. For example, $10$ can only be written as $3^2 + 1^2$ (we don't count $1^2 + 3^2$ as being different). On the other hand, $25$ can be written as $5^2 + 0^2$ or as $4^2 + 3^2$.
