# Problem

A number is called $n$-factorful if it has exactly $n$ distinct prime factors. Given positive integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, your task is to find the number of integers between $a$ and $b$, inclusive, that are $n$-factorful. We consider $1$ to be $0$-factorful.

## Input

Your input will consist of a single integer #T# followed by a newline and #T# test cases.  
Each test cases consists of a single line containing integers $a$, $b$, and $n$ as described above.
